### Education

I am a Ph.D. candidate student in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Arlington, supervised by Dr. Junzhou Huang.  
I obtained my M.S. degree from Shenzhen University in 2019, and B.S. degree from Shenzhen University in 2016.

### Research Interest

My main research focuses on machine learning, particularly graph neural networks, language models, and domain adaptation. I’ve also gained extensive hands-on experience collaborating with companies like Tencent AI Lab and Watrix AI, where I developed genomic analysis algorithms and gait recognition systems. Recently, I’ve explored multimodal composed image retrieval using large language models.
